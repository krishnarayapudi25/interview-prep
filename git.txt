git checkout:The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch . 
              Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.
The git status: command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, 
            which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.
